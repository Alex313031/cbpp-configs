# cbpp-configs

A repo for [*(IMO)*](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/96/33/5c963335465442af362cb872d937940c.jpg)
optimal UI configs for [CrunchBang++ Linux](https://crunchbangplusplus.org/).

 - Meant to be a private store for multiple installs of cbpp, to prevent having
 to recreate these by hand.

### Contents

Has configs for [jgmenu](https://jgmenu.github.io/), [tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2), [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky),
as well as openbox itself which is what [CrunchBang](https://crunchbang.org/) and its decendents
[CrunchBang++](https://github.com/CBPP/cbpp) (CBPP) and [Bunsenlabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/)
use for their [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment).
